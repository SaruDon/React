      <h1>This is my 1st React app with vite</h1>
      <h2>Faster Development</h2>
      <p>
        Vite starts up quickly and provides instant feedback when you make
        changes, thanks to its fast hot module replacement (HMR).
      </p>
      <h2>No Bundling During Development</h2>
    <p>It uses native ES modules, so it doesn't need to bundle the whole app while you're developing, which speeds things up.</p>

    <h2>Optimized Builds</h2>
    <p>For production, Vite uses Rollup to create optimized, smaller, and faster bundles.</p>

    <h2>Simple Setup</h2>
    <p>Vite is easy to set up with minimal configuration, making it great for quick projects.</p>

    <h2>Supports Modern Features</h2>
    <p>It supports TypeScript, JSX, and various CSS preprocessors out of the box, so you can use the latest web technologies easily.</p>

    <h2>Great Plugin System</h2>
    <p>Vite has a strong plugin ecosystem, allowing you to add extra features or customize your build process.</p>

    <h2>Wide Framework Support</h2>
    <p>Works well with frameworks like Vue, React, Svelte, and more, providing flexibility in your choice of tools.</p>
